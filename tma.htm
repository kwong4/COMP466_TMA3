			<h3>Requirements:</h3>
			<p>In parts 3 and 4 of this assignment, you will be developing an online computer store in which customers can select a computer from a list and customize it by replacing some components in its standard configuration with others that may be better or cheaper. Customers can then place an order with the online store.  In part 1, focus on the web interface design and implementation of the online store, using ASP.NET in C# and other web technologies you have learned from Units 1–5. The requirements are as follows:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Visit some online stores such as Bestbuy.CA and Amazon.CA, study their designs and functionalities, and write your findings in the assignment report.</li>
				<li>Based on your study above, analyze the requirements of the web application you are to develop and then work out a design of the web application, including drawings of the interface, name and functions of each modules you will need, and web pages/documents to be used.</li>
				<li>The application running in a web browser should be like a real online store, with a name and logo, menus and buttons for navigation, a welcome page to greet customers, and other pages, such as contacts and a feedback form, and so on.</li>
				<li>There should be a list of computers, lists of different parts or components (no less than five different components including at least RAM, hard drive, CPU, display, OS, and soundcard) of computers that can be reviewed by customers. At this stage, the information about these products can be hard-coded into the HTML or program files.</li>
				<li>A customer can select a computer with default/standard configuration and pricing, and then customize it by changing its configuration, that is, by replacing one component with another from a list of compatible components.</li>
				<li>Whenever a change has been made by the customer, the price total needs to be dynamically changed and displayed to the customer, in an area embedded in the online store, not in a pop-up window.</li>
				<li>After the customer has hit the Buy or Add to Cart or something similar, a summary of selections, including all the details of the customized computer and its pricing, should be displayed in the browser window.</li>
				<li>At this stage, you don’t need to save orders placed by customers in the database. You can use Cookies to store and track customer selections.</li>
				<li>All links, menus, and buttons within the online store should be active.</li>
			</ol>

			<hr/>
			<h3>Requirements:</h3>
			<p>In part 4 of the assignment, you will continue your work completed in part 3, to develop a fully functioning online computer store (without payment transaction, though). Your tasks for this part are:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Add a customer management module to the online computer store, which should include new customer registration, customer authentication, and password recovery.</li>
				<li>Add an order management module which will save orders for registered customers and allow registered customers to manage their orders, including view the list and details of each item in the list and delete or make changes to a selected order in the list.</li>
				<li>Design and implement a back-end database to support your online computer store that does the following.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Store all the details of the computers and components and replace all the data hard-coded into the program files with data from the database.</li>
					<li>Use the database for all your customer management.</li>
					<li>Use the database for all your order management. When an order is submitted, the details of the order, including pricing, need to be saved in the database, and then displayed in an appropriate format to the customer.</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
